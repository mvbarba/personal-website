HUEb is a 3D first-person puzzle game made in Unity, inspired by Portal and Antichamber. In HUEb, you jump between dimensions in order to solve 3D physics puzzles. The game was initially created for the WGJ, in which it received 2nd place out of over 70 entries.

I wrote multiple custom shaders for this project in HLSL, which can be seen in the forcefield surrounding the elevator buttons, the outline that stylizes the entire game, and the dissolve effect that appears on objects when you change dimensions.

By quickly coming up with a game mechanic that was easy to expand into multiple levels, we were able to spend a lot of time on polish, making the game feel clean and satisfying to play. 

All around, I am super proud of the game, especially for being made in under a week.
