ARORA (Augmented Reality Object Recognition App) is an app created for iOS, Android, and Windows devices that I lead the development of with some friends that was originally created for the NASA HUNCH Design and Prototyping Competition. 

We won at the National level for this competition, and also brought the app to the Career Pathways Competition of SkilsUSA, where it won first place at the District and State level, and second nationally (I am pictured in the back giving a thumbs-up, pardon my messy haircut at the time).

This app was designed to detect and identify important objects on the International Space Station in order to improve organization for astronauts.

Once an object is detected, you are given the ability to observe the 3D model of the object, get important information about the object, and view tutorials related to the object in the app.

The app connects to a database to compare the camera input to the stored items and identify it. Once the item is identified, you can break the object down into individual parts, and view even more specific information such as part numbers. This is useful if a replacement part on an object needs to be found.
